                <h2>A brief history</h2>
                <div class="history-content">
                    <p>My career has been characterized by a passion for risk mitigation and a drive to leverage
                        technological advancements for improvement, resulting in consistently impactful solutions. I've
                        automated critical call center processes, architected IT infrastructures in manufacturing, built
                        robust cybersecurity programs within a Fortune 20 financial institution, and developed highly
                        profitable customer-facing cybersecurity services for a leading technology company.</p>

                    <p>My journey began in a high-volume call center where I identified and automated critical
                        processes, significantly improving efficiency. Transitioning to the manufacturing sector, I
                        built foundational IT infrastructures from the ground up, establishing a solid base for future
                        technological advancements. These early experiences ingrained in me the importance of practical,
                        results-driven technology implementation.</p>

                    <p>At a Fortune 20 financial institution, I expanded my expertise into comprehensive cybersecurity
                        leadership. I led multi-year enterprise security initiatives, conducted rigorous internal
                        audits, and developed strategic vendor and internal cybersecurity roadmaps. I built the
                        Enterprise Information Security Risk Management program and spearheaded efforts to integrate and
                        optimize security operations, ensuring robust protection for critical assets and data.</p>

                    <p>My most recent experience at a leading cybersecurity vendor allowed me to leverage my accumulated
                        knowledge to drive innovation in threat hunting. I automated and integrated threat hunting
                        products and services, delivered impactful industry talks, and created highly profitable
                        customer-facing training, sharing my leadership and expertise with a global audience.</p>

                    <p>My commitment to continuous learning is rooted in a philosophy of mastery: learning a skill,
                        certifying its proficiency, teaching it to others, and ultimately, sharing thought leadership
                        within the community. This dedication is evidenced by my dozens of industry certifications and
                        advanced education, including a Master's degree in Cyber Threat Intelligence, and is reinforced
                        by my ongoing professional development. I am passionate about driving efficiency and innovation,
                        particularly through emerging technologies, with my latest focus on mastering generative AI, a
                        technology I believe will shape the future.</p>

                    <p>While I draw upon past experiences to inform my
                        understanding of future trends, my true passion lies in exploring and shaping what's next. I am
                        genuinely energized by conversations about the future, often needing to temper my enthusiasm. My
                        ultimate aspiration is to contribute meaningfully to the secure enablement of humanity's
                        technological evolution. With this vision in mind, I am eager to apply my expertise in
                        enterprise risk, threat and vulnerability management, and security operations along with my
                        thirst for technology to drive impactful results and contribute to the future of technology.</p>
