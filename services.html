<div class="container">  <h1>Stop Talking *At* Your Security Program. Start Talking *With* It. (aka, Virtual CISO Services - *My* Take)</h1>

    <div class="service-box">  <p>Let's be honest, security isn't just about checking boxes. It's about understanding your business, your risks, and how to protect what matters most. I'm a **CISO Whisperer**, and I can help you build a security program that actually *works*.</p>

        <p>I offer fractional/virtual CISO services designed to give your organization the strategic security leadership it needs, without the hefty price tag of a full-time executive. Whether you're a small startup, a rapidly growing medium-sized business, or a large enterprise, I can help you build a robust and resilient security posture. I work directly with you, understanding your unique challenges and developing solutions tailored to *your* specific needs.</p>

        <h2>What I Do:</h2>

        <h3>Virtual CISO/Fractional CISO</h3>
        <p>I act as your dedicated security advisor, developing and implementing security strategies tailored to your specific needs and risk profile. Think of me as your on-demand CISO, minus the corner office (and the six-figure salary). I'm in the trenches with you, not just dictating from on high.</p>

        <h3>Audit Whisperer (with a 27001 Focus)</h3>
        <p>Preparing for ISO 27001 audits can feel like navigating a minefield. I've been there, done that, and got the t-shirt (and the certifications). With over a decade of experience performing internal audits for everyone from medium-sized manufacturers to Fortune 50 companies, I'll guide *you* through the ISO 27001 certification process, ensuring you're not just compliant, but truly secure. I'll help you understand the *why* behind the standard, not just the *what*.</p>

        <h3>Internal Audit Training (Especially for 27001)</h3>
        <p>Want to build *your* own internal audit dream team, particularly skilled in ISO 27001? I offer comprehensive training programs for internal auditors, risk assessors, advisors, and consultants. I'll equip your team with the skills and knowledge they need to effectively assess and manage risk within the context of ISO 27001. I've trained large teams, so I know what it takes to get everyone on the same page. I focus on practical application, not just theory, with a strong emphasis on the specific requirements of ISO 27001.</p>

        <h3>Security Strategy & Leadership</h3>
        <p>Beyond audits, I provide strategic guidance on all aspects of cybersecurity, from risk management and vulnerability assessments to incident response planning and security awareness training. Consider me your trusted advisor, your sounding board, and your secret weapon in the fight against cyber threats. I'm passionate about helping businesses like yours thrive in the face of evolving threats, and ISO 27001 provides a great framework for that.</p>

        <h3>Expert Communication & Collaboration</h3>
        <p>I've served as the primary escalation point for global customers dealing with audit and penetration testing results. I'm comfortable communicating complex technical issues to both technical and non-technical audiences. I've even shared the stage with CISOs at conferences, roundtables, and panel discussions. I speak fluent "CISO," and I can translate it for you. I believe in clear, concise communication, and I'll keep you informed every step of the way, especially when it comes to the nuances of ISO 27001.</p>
